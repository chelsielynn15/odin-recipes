  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This dessert is an absolute blast from the past for me and a real hit with all the children in our family. Back in Sydney, there was a bakery that made Mađarica the absolute best. That’s right; not even my mother could measure up to this bakery’s Mađarica. Anytime we had a party, the Mađarica was purchased, and all the children would scoff it down as soon as it hit the table.</p>
  <p>When you find yourself in Croatia, the region of Slavonia is known for delicious Mađarica and other desserts, too! Don’t miss them. If you aren’t traveling anytime soon, have no fear. We’ve got a recipe you can whip up in your own kitchen. We love this chocolate slice and hope you do as well!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Cake Layers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>600 g all-purpose flour (4 cups)</li>
   <li>1/2 tsp. baking powder</li>
  <li>Two egg whites</li>
  <li>220 ml cream (1 cup)</li>
  <li>150 g sugar (3/4 cup)</li>
  <li>180 g butter (13 Tbls.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Filling</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 L milk (4 1/4 cups)</li>
  <li>140 g butter (10 Tbls.)</li>
  <li>200 g sugar (1 cup)</li>
  <li>200 g chocolate (7 oz)</li>
  <li>5 Tbls. all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
</ul>
<h3>Glaze</h3>
<ul>
  <li>180 g chocolate (6.3 oz)</li>
  <li>3 Tbls. oil</li>
  <li>50 g butter (3 1/2 tablespoons)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<h3>Filling</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Cook the milk with sugar and vanilla until it boils.</li>
  <li>Take out a cup of milk and whisk the flour into the milk. Slowly pour in the flour and milk mixture into the boiling milk and continue to stir.</li>
  <li>Turn down the heat and add the chocolate and stir continuously until the chocolate melts and the filling thickens.</li>
  <li>Remove from heat and stir in the butter.</li>
  <li>Put it aside and let the mixture cool. It should be completely cool before using it.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cake Layers</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
  <li>Now you need to make a dough. Beat butter with sugar, egg whites, and cream add sift in the flour and baking powder, and knead into a dough.</li>
  <li>Separate it into five equal parts and roll each one out into rectangles. I usually use a cake tin as a template, so I know the size and shape that I need to roll the dough. Also, I also like to roll it on baking paper; that way, it's easy to transfer the dough onto the baking tray.</li>
  <li>Roll the dough as thin as possible and place it on a baking tray ready for cooking.</li>
  <li>Bake layers one by one, each for 8-9 minutes. You want the layers to stay light in color. Once baked, put them on a flat surface and let them cool.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Glaze</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Melt the chocolate with butter and oil over simmering water. When it's well combined, it's ready.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Assembly</h3>
<ol>  
  <li>Now it's time to assemble the layers of the cake. First, place one layer of the cooked dough onto a baking tray and then spread part of the filling on the cake.</li>
  <li>Cover with the second layer of cooked dough and repeat.</li>
  <li>You need to end with the dough layer on top; you then finish with the glaze. Simply pour the glaze over the cake and then refrigerate overnight.</li>
  <li>The next day cut into small rectangles and serve.</li>
</ol>
