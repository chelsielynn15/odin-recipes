  <h2>Description</h2>
<p>With crisp edges, thick centers, and room for lots of decorating icing, I know you’ll love these soft cut out sugar cookies. Use your favorite cookie cutters and try my classic royal icing.</p>
<p>These are my favorite sugar cookies with icing. I shared the recipe on Sally’s Baking Addiction several years ago and published them in my cookbook as well. I’ve made them at least 38577 times (imagine all the butter), so I figured it’s time to share new recipe tips, a video tutorial, and more helpful information.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2.5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
   <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
  <li>3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
  <li>2 sticks unsalted butter <i>at room temperature.</i></li>
  <li>1 1/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
  <li>1 large egg plus egg yolk</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
  <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt to combine.</li>
  <li>In a large bowl, use an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high speed to beat the butter and 1¼ cups sugar until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl. Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla, and beat until combined, scraping the bowl down as needed. Slowly beat in the flour mixture.</li>
  <li>Place the remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a shallow dish. Using a large (3-tablespoon) spring-loaded scoop, divide the dough into balls, then roll in sugar to coat evenly. Place the dough balls on the prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart, and flatten slightly with the bottom of a measuring cup.</li>
  <li>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies set and begin to brown. Cool for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.</li>
</ol>
