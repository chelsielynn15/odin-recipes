  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Today I’m sharing a cookie recipe that is near and dear to my heart… almond crescent cookies. This recipe is a remake of my nanny’s crescent cookies that we’ve made every single year for Christmas since I was a little girl. The combo of a crisp pecan shortbread cookie paired with the sweet, melt-in-your-mouth powered sugar coating is so delicious and nostalgic!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>1cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons almond extract</li>
        <li>2 1⁄3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup ground almonds</li>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>

        <li>Working with 1 tablespoon of dough at a time, lightly roll and then shape it so the middle is thicker than both ends. Bend dough log into a crescent shape.</li>
